SushiChain is a blockchain written in the [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) programming language. It was founded by [Taichiro Suzuki](https://github.com/tbrand) at the start of 2018.

I ([Kingsley](https://github.com/kingsleyh)) have been really interested in all the amazing blockchain projects that have been popping up everywhere. I started playing with various blockchain platforms such as [Neo](https://neo.org/) and [Lisk](https://lisk.io/) which inspired me to have a go at writing my own blockchain. 

I had recently discovered Crystal and decided I wanted to build my blockchain ideally in Crystal but if not then perhaps the D language. I put together a very basic blockchain in Crystal - and then while researching I stumbled across a Crystal blockchain project called SushiCoin. 

After playing around with SushiCoin I instantly loved it! Over the next few months I started contributing heavily until Taichiro invited me to be a co-owner of the repository after which I have now turned into a Co-creator and Core Developer.

We have pooled our ideas and thoughts on what the most awesome features of our blockchain could be and we have started implementing them.

We are aiming to make a first Mainnet release towards the end of 2018. Over the coming months I will be documenting our progress, discussing my thoughts and ideas about cryptocurrencies and blockchains. If you are lucky Taichiro may also share a blog post or two here :)
