The latest feature we added to SushiChain was the ability to create custom tokens. As part of this feature we introduced our default token called SHARI. 

SHARI is used to power the blockchain. All transaction fees are in SHARI and all SCARS operations are in SHARI. But what on earth is this strange name? It's actually the key ingredient when making Sushi because it's the sushi rice! True to it's name SHARI is also the key ingredient in SushiChain.

We can see a list of all the tokens created on SushiChain using the `sushi` command line client as follows:

```
./sushi token list -n http://testnet.sushichain.io:3000
```

Creating and using tokens is very straightforward with the `sushi` client:

```
./sushi token create -w fullmetal-testnet.json -f 1000 -m 100000000 --token=KINGS -n http://testnet.sushichain.io:3000
```

The fee is currently 1000 and so here I created one hundred million KINGS tokens. Once the token create transaction has been processed and confirmed it will show up in the list of tokens and be available for use.

You can only mine SHARI. So the only way to get some tokens is to receive them from someone or create your own and give them to others. We envisage that tokens will be used together with our decentralised applications platform (dApps) in the future.

I will go into more detail about the dApp system in a future post.
